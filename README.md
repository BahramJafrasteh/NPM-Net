        A Multi-modal Multi-task Deep Convolutional Neural Network
                      for Pre-processing of MRI and 3D Ultrasound Images
===============================================================================

Description:
------------
Neuroimaging studies are fundamental in neuroscience research, where preprocessing serves as a foundational step. This project introduces the Neuroimaging Multi-Modal Preprocessing Network (NMP-Net), a deep learning-based approach tailored for brain extraction and image reconstruction from both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3D ultrasound (US) images. Additionally, NMP-Net is utilized for predicting total brain volume (TBV) from 3D US images.

Usage:
------
1. Install the package
4. Utilize the trained model for brain extraction, image reconstruction, and TBV estimation tasks as per your requirements.

Note:
-----
The paper has not been published. We will release the code and network weights upon acceptance.
